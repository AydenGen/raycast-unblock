# What is Raycast Unblock

**Raycast Unblock** is a *third-party* project aimed at unlocking all features in the Raycast Pro Plan by implementing similar functionality *in other ways*.

## Disclaimer

We only borrowed the **operation interface** of Raycast, and **did not modify the backend server** of Raycast.

We just coded a proxy server to forward Raycast's requests to our proxy server, and **implemented similar functions** in Raycast Pro Plan **in other ways**.

You can see all the code in the `src` directory. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
